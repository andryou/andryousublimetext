# Andrew's Sublime Text Settings
This will be a work-in-progress, but I have shared my current configuration file so that others can take options that they like :)

## Features:
* uses an extremely readable font (DejaVu Sans Mono) to display the code
* makes use of Sublime's nifty code re-indent feature
* increased code readability through extra padding, highlighting of the current line/modified files, and other minor features

For more information, read the below list :)

## Detailed Features:
* Uses the Cobalt theme by default
* Bolds folder labels
* Uses the Phase caret
* Shows the code fold buttons
* Default font face is DejaVu Sans Mono: http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download
* Default font size is 8px
* Highlight current line is enabled
* Highlight any modified tabs (and also save any files on lost focus) enabled
* Added 1px of padding to the top and bottom of lines
* Open all files in the same window
* SHIFT+TAB will unindent the current line
* Won't remember open files upon exit

## Custom Hotkeys:
* CTRL+SHIFT+R - reindents the current file
* CTRL+V - pastes and re-indents clipboard contents
* CTRL+SHIFT+V - pastes the clipboard contents normally (no re-indenting)
